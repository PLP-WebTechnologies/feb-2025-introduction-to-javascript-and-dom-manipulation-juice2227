        <p>
          HerZone254 is a youth-led initiative focused on ending femicide and
          GBV through awareness, education, and empowerment.
          <br />

          HerZone254 started with a question: What can we do to protect women
          and girls in our own communities? We're a group of young creators,
          coders, poets, and changemakers using our voices to stand against GBV
          and femicide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, our work encompasses:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Providing Essential Services: We
          offer comprehensive support, including counseling, legal aid, and
          practical resources, tailored to the unique needs of each survivor.

            </li>
            <li>
              Creating Safe Spaces: We establish
          secure and supportive environments where survivors can find refuge and
          begin their journey towards recovery.

            </li>
            <li>
              Advocating for Systemic Change: We actively challenge the deep-seated
          patriarchal structures that perpetuate violence, pushing for policy
          reforms and societal shifts that promote equality and justice.

      <h2>What is GBV & Femicide?</h2>
      <p>
        Learn about the different types of gender-based violence and how
        femicide affects women and girls across Kenya.

            GBV is any harm done to someone based on their gender. In Kenya,
            this includes domestic violence, sexual assault, and even online
            harassment. Femicide is the intentional killing of a woman because
            she is a woman. These acts often go unreported ‚Äî but they affect us
            all.
